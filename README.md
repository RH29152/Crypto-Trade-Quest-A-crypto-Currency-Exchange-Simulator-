# **Crypto Trade Quest**

## **Overview**

**Crypto Trade Quest** is a console-based crypto exchange simulation developed as part of the **OOP (C++) course** during my 2nd semester. The project demonstrates a simplified model of a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance, processing trade data and executing trades using a matching engine.

## **Features**

- **CSV Data Handling:** Processes and filters trade data from a 3500-line CSV file.
- **Matching Engine:** Matches buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders.
- **Wallet Integration:** Manages trades by checking and updating wallet balances.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizes vectors, maps, and sets for efficient data management.
- **Exception Handling:** Provides user-friendly error handling.

## **Learning Outcomes**

1. **Crypto Exchange Mechanics:** Understanding of cryptocurrencies and the functioning of crypto exchanges.
2. **OOP Abstractions:** Applied OOP principles such as encapsulation and composition.
3. **Data Manipulation:** Filtered and processed large datasets using C++ file handling.
4. **Project Structure:** Managed project files and dependencies using header files.
5. **Code Quality:** Focused on code readability, cleanliness, and reusability.
6. **Exception Handling:** Implemented robust exception handling mechanisms.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Makefile (optional for easier compilation)

### **Installation and Running the Program**

#### **Steps:**

1. **Download all files:**
   - Download all .cpp and .h files into the same folder.

2. **Compile the project:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to compile the project:
     ```sh
     g++ *.cpp -o main
     ```

3. **Run the program:**
   - After compiling, run the executable with the following command:
     ```sh
     ./main
     ```

4. **There you go!**
   - Your program should now be running.
